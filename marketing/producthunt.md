## Description

VoicePrompter is a free, open-source teleprompter that uses voice recognition to automatically scroll your script as you speak.

🎯 **Problem**
Recording videos with a traditional teleprompter means constantly adjusting scroll speed. Speak faster? You lose your place. Pause to think? The text keeps moving.

💡 **Solution**
VoicePrompter listens to what you're saying and matches it to your script in real-time. The text follows YOU, not the other way around.

✨ **Features**
• 🎤 Voice tracking — scrolls automatically based on speech
• 📹 Camera mode — see yourself while reading
• 🎨 7 beautiful themes
• ⚡ Adjustable font size & speed
• 📱 Works on iPhone, Android, and Desktop
• 🆓 100% free, no signup required
• 🔓 Open source

🎬 **Perfect for**
• YouTube creators
• TikTok / Instagram Reels
• Online course instructors
• Podcasters reading show notes
• Anyone who records videos

Built by a content creator who was tired of NG-ing 50 times per video.

## First Comment (Maker Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built VoicePrompter because my wife kept complaining about teleprompter apps while recording her videos.

The main pain point: you have to guess the scroll speed, and if you pause or speed up, everything gets out of sync.

So I thought — why not just make it LISTEN?

Using the Web Speech API, VoicePrompter matches what you're saying to your script and scrolls to the right position automatically.

It's:
- Free forever (no freemium tricks)
- Open source
- Works entirely in the browser

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?
