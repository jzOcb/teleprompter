1/🧵 I built a free teleprompter with VOICE TRACKING

No more manual scrolling while recording videos.

It listens to what you say and scrolls automatically.

Here's how it works 👇

2/ The problem:
- Recording videos with a teleprompter = constantly adjusting scroll speed
- Miss a line? Everything's off
- Hands busy = can't control scrolling

3/ The solution:
Voice-tracking teleprompter

✅ Speaks Chinese? It follows along
✅ Speaks English? It follows along  
✅ Speak faster? It speeds up
✅ Pause? It waits

4/ Features:
- 🎤 Voice tracking (Web Speech API)
- 📹 Camera preview mode
- 🎨 7 themes
- 📱 Works on iPhone, Android, Desktop
- 💰 100% FREE, no signup

5/ Try it now:
https://jzocb.github.io/teleprompter/

Built for content creators who are tired of NG-ing 50 times per video.

Open source: github.com/jzOcb/teleprompter

What feature should I add next?
